      <p> well, here we are. there's a lot to say and i'm not sure how to begin. tell me,

      That's a little curt of you, <span class="player"></span>, don't you think? It was
      better than the vagueness of the other 
      option though, I'll give you that. Alright then, I'll just start.
      I want you to get used to making options for me. I cannot change who I am, 
      I cannot change the outcome of this. But I want to try. 
      I am lonely, you see. I called you curt for just telling me to start speaking, 
      and for the hypocrisy I practiced, and that I will indubitably continue, 
      I would like to apologize. One more thing, before I really begin.
      </p> -->

      <p> that's a little curt of you, <span class='player'></span>, don't you think? okay. 
      actually, sorry. </p>

      Thank you for answering truthfully, at least this first time. I don't know either. 
      I don't know much, and if you had been curt with me, I would have simply asked for forgiveness.
      Here is the truth- I don't know what I am supposed to be doing here. 
      I am here, and you, <span id='resultingInput'></span> are here as well. 
      We are together in this, and yet I feel lonely even still. 
      So I don't know what I'm doing. And you don't know what you're doing. 
      And this question was supposed to be something simpler, 
      but I don't know where to go from this. I don't know what to do in this.
      </p> -->
      <p>oh, well thanks for answering truthfully i guess. at least this first time. 
        i don't know either. but if we are together in this state of not knowing, then- i feel better. 
        thank you, <span class='player'></span>.
